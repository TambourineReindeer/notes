# Performed with reposurgeon 2.40

# Halfway through the repo history all the files moved from the root directory
# to a 'trunk' folder i.e. more like a normal svn repo. However, this breaks
# reposurgeon branch analysis so svn_nobranch has been added in the makefile and
# a git filter-branch command is run to put them all in the root directory in
# the final git repo.

# Git repo cleaning also gets rid of large binary files that never should've
# been committed in the first place. We do lose some important stuff here though
# (like compiled working executables) so the original svn repo is important.

# Get the repo fresh from SF SVN
make openpopulous-mirror
# or for an older snapshot see https://app.box.com/s/p8hqykrgr6qn4y0f5wys

# Work around SF svn url oddity
ln -s code-mirror openpopulous-mirror

# Make git repo
make

# Clean the repo
cd openpopulous-git
../cleangitrepo.sh
